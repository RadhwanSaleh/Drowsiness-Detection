# Drowsiness-Detection

In this code, non-intrusive, lightweight, and accurate drowsiness detection approach was developed. 
Viola and Jone's method is utilized for face and mouth detection. 
Thereafter, twenty-two texture features are extracted from the region of interest (mouth). 
These features serve as inputs to the neural network that was trained with recent meta-heuristic optimization algorithms in order to detect the yawning state of the frames. 
Finally,  a novel temporal method is proposed for detecting the drowsy driver based on the yawning results of sequential frames over a period of time.
